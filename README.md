## About the project 📝

My approach to the project structure stems from my previous work, among other things. All files are placed in appropriate directories. I could also make a folder with constant variables, but I didn't see the need here, since it's a small project. Unfortunately, I did not have time to improve the unit tests, but you can still review their code.

## How to run project ⚙️

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test or npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\

**Note: If any given functionality does not work properly, it is due to my misinterpretation of how it should work properly.**
